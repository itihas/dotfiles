# dotfiles
My Emacs and GUI-related dotfiles. I run Arch Linux with Xmonad, xmobar, and stalonetray. XTerm is default terminal.

Everything is Solarized-themed.

Xmonad modifier is changed to Super/Windows.

Xmobar is configured to be tiny and unobtrusive.

Stalonetray sits above xmobar.

My .emacs, as far as possible, is documented in the comments.
